# Template for the getkono/homebrew-tap formula. The Release-plz workflow's
# "update-tap" job fills in the version and four SHA-256 values below on each
# release, then commits the rendered file to the tap. The capitalised tokens
# are substituted automatically -- leave them intact when editing. Lint with:
#   ruby -c .github/homebrew/tree-tui.rb
#   brew style .github/homebrew/tree-tui.rb

  # The binary is named `tree` (it intentionally shadows the classic `tree`),

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      tree-tui installs its binary as `tree`, shadowing the classic `tree`
      command on your PATH. Invoke it as `tree [dir]` (defaults to .).
      Keep only one of the two, or run the other via its full path.
